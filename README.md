                      Description

● Open the current Revolut app, on either iOS or Android, and navigate to the exchange screen.

● If the app is not available in your country, you can observe how the application works in this video: https://youtu.be/c0zPSiKYipc?t=29s. (Exchange screen is at the 29th second of the video).
P.S. It is not required to implement the rates screen (1:05 in the video).

● Implement the functionality of this screen only in your own custom web widget, using FX rates from any of these sources:

● http://www.ecb.int/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/index.en.html#dev ○ https://openexchangerates.org/

● your preferred source of FX rates.

                 Business requirements

● Refresh the rate every 10s (we do not expect the rate to change every 10s as most free rate sources won't provide live rates).

● Contain at least three currency accounts with USD, EUR, GBP.

● Make it possible to make an exchange between accounts.

● Contain two inputs on the exchange screen for both accounts. Each input should be
validated to let the user type only numbers with two digits after the dot.

● Give all the necessary information: exchange rate between active accounts and account
balances.

                     Tech requirements
 
● The app is written in React.

● Typed JavaScript (we love TypeScript).

● Test your application with Jest.

● Use any libraries that you think are a reasonable choice for this task.

● Don't hesitate to use the latest technologies and design patterns. Only the latest modern
browsers (Chrome/Safari) are your limitation.

● Please make sure your package.json contains:
○ "start" script -- should launch the app on localhost.
○ "test" script -- should run tests in your app.

                     Implicit requirements


● The widget must work and produce correct results.

● Test your app before writing to us that it is ready.

● The code produced is expected to be of a high standard.

● You can implement the widget with any design you want, but you should make it look
nice.
